**Skryper** is a streamlined tool designed to help developers scan, analyze, and organize their projectâ€™s file structure while adhering to `.gitignore` rules. Skryper simplifies the task of maintaining an organized and clutter-free codebase, especially in large, collaborative projects.

## Overview

In fast-paced development environments, managing files across large projects can become complex and time-consuming. Skryper addresses this challenge by providing a clear view of the file landscape, ensuring that only the relevant files are tracked and managed. By focusing on the files that matter, Skryper helps you maintain a clean, efficient, and manageable codebase.

## Key Features

- **Directory Scanning**: Recursively scans directories, generating a clear and organized file structure.
- **`.gitignore` Compliance**: Honors `.gitignore` rules, automatically excluding files that should not be tracked.
- **On-Demand Logging**: Logging can be enabled during execution to generate detailed logs for debugging and auditing purposes.

## Installation

1. **Download Skryper**

   - Visit the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jonaszeihe/skryper/releases) page to download the latest version of Skryper.

2. **Setup**

   - Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use Skryper, simply run the `skryper.exe` in the directory where you want to scan the file structure.

1. **Running Skryper**:

   - Navigate to the directory containing `skryper.exe`.
   - Double-click `skryper.exe` or run it via Command Prompt or Git Bash:
     ```bash
     ./skryper.exe
     ```
   - This will scan the current directory and save the directory structure to a timestamped file.

2. **Enabling Logging**:

   - If you encounter issues or need detailed logs, you can run Skryper with logging enabled:
     ```bash
     ./skryper.exe --logging
     ```
   - This will scan the directory and additionally save a detailed log file.

### Running from Command Prompt or Git Bash

- Open Command Prompt or Git Bash in the directory where `skryper.exe` is located:
  - Navigate to the directory:
    ```cmd
    cd C:\path\to\skryper
    ```
  - Run Skryper with or without logging:
    ```cmd
    skryper.exe          # For a normal run
    skryper.exe --logging # For a run with logging enabled
    ```

## Development

If you are interested in contributing to Skryper or wish to modify it for your own purposes, you can set up a development environment by following these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   - Clone the Skryper repository from GitHub:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/jonaszeihe/skryper.git
     cd skryper
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   - It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Install Development Dependencies**

   - Install the dependencies required for development:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run Skryper in Development Mode**

   - You can now run Skryper directly from the source code for testing and development:
     ```bash
     python src/main.py --dir /path/to/your/project
     ```

5. **Build the Executable**
   - To build the executable for Skryper, use PyInstaller:
     ```bash
     pyinstaller --name skryper --onefile --specpath src --noconfirm src/main.py
     ```
   - This will generate a standalone executable in the `dist/` directory.

## Integration with Structra

Skryper is designed to work seamlessly with [Structra](https://github.com/JonasZeihe/structra), another tool available on my GitHub profile. Structra takes the file structure generated by Skryper and visualizes it, providing a comprehensive view of your project's architecture.

## AI-Aided Development
